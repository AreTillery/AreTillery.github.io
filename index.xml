      <description>TL;DR: Tillery has deep-dive knowledge in training and education, AppSec, and exploitation development. They also love threat modeling. And corgis.
Tillery has been an educator in one form or another longer than just about any other professional or intellectual pursuit. Graduating with both Maths and Computer Science (with concentrations in teacher&amp;rsquo;s ed, HPC, and Data Science) in undergrad, they started their post-baccalaureate life teaching maths in public schools, but that didn&amp;rsquo;t last.</description>
