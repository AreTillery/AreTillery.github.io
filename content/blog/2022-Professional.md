What does 2022 hold for me professionally?

2021 was a tough year for me. I travelled several times during the year, and every single time, it was for a funeral. As the end of 2021 approached, one of the things I realized is that I wanted to stop letting myself be afraid of taking risks and letting things pass me by.

One of the things I realized is that while I had been given an amazing opportunity to come in and build something where I was, I had reached a point where I was happy with what I built, and wanted to build something new, for myself this time, instilled with my ideals.

Near the end of the year, I decided that I was going to go one of two ways: either start a company entirely by myself, or partner with someone that I cared about and knew would help me build something with my ideals in mind. So I approached a good friend.

It's taken a bit of time to get everything sorted to the point that I wanted to announce where I am and what I'm doing, but now's the time!

Together with some other trusted folks, we've founded a new company, focused on a holistic approach to cyber training and consulting, particularly around cyber risk: [Neuvik](https://twitter.com/Neuvik) [Solutions](https://www.linkedin.com/company/neuvik-solutions/). Everything we do couples meaningful, tactical lessons with top-tier organizational guidance.

We've existed in earnest since January. It's really cool and I'm really proud of what we've done so far. Greetz to [Ryan Leirvik](https://twitter.com/Leirvik), [David Mayer](https://twitter.com/dmay3r), and [Alexandria Esposito](https://twitter.com/bigalespo) who form our leadership Steering Committee with me, and [Moses Frost](https://twitter.com/mosesrenegade), who has come on board our red team. Looking forward to 2022!
