      <description>&amp;ldquo;women and non-binary&amp;rdquo; is a common phrase used by well-intentioned people trying to express that folks that don&amp;rsquo;t identify as a binary (male or female) gender are welcome. The trouble is that it isn&amp;rsquo;t clear who is welcome, because non-binary is not a monolith.
Whenever the phrase &amp;ldquo;women and non-binary&amp;rdquo; is used, for example, it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s erasing the identities of a lot of trans and non-binary folks. Often, people who don&amp;rsquo;t understand what it means to be non-binary view or refer to &amp;ldquo;non-binary&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;women-lite&amp;rdquo; - that is, they treat what is a complex group of gender identities as if they were one identity on the women side of some sort of gender spectrum.</description>

      <description>In case it&amp;rsquo;s helpful in someone else&amp;rsquo;s experience, below is the email I sent to the internal all-hands email at work regarding my name change.
 GRIMM family,
For those of you that want to skip to the end, here&amp;rsquo;s the short form: My name is now Tillery, and I use they/them pronouns. Email address and public key are changing.
As many of you already know, about a year ago I came out as non-binary.</description>

      <description>Hello, Internet! This is the long-form version of the about me twitter thread I posted.
There are a lot of things that I am, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what order to put them into. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of taxonomies when they apply to other things, but bad at labels when they come to me. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll just get started.
Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Tillery! I&amp;rsquo;m non-binary and use they/them pronouns. When I first realized I was non-binary and came out, I identified as demimale and used he or they interchangeably - that isn&amp;rsquo;t the case anymore.</description>

      <description>NOTE: This post is outdated. It remains here for historical curiosity only. For an up-to-date look at who I am, check out the about page. Hello friends, family, and the internet at large!
For a small handful of you, this isn&amp;rsquo;t news, but for some of you it is. I wanted to do this in a way that gave me a chance to find my words, and also share this information with everyone I care about in one place.</description>
