      <description>In case it&amp;rsquo;s helpful in someone else&amp;rsquo;s experience, below is the email I sent to the internal all-hands email at work regarding my name change.
 GRIMM family,
For those of you that want to skip to the end, here&amp;rsquo;s the short form: My name is now Tillery, and I use they/them pronouns. Email address and public key are changing.
As many of you already know, about a year ago I came out as non-binary.</description>
