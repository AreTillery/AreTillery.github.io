      <description>Hello, Internet! This is the long-form version of the about me twitter thread I posted.
There are a lot of things that I am, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what order to put them into. I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of taxonomies when they apply to other things, but bad at labels when they come to me. I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll just get started.
Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Tillery! I&amp;rsquo;m non-binary and use they/them pronouns. When I first realized I was non-binary and came out, I identified as demimale and used he or they interchangeably - that isn&amp;rsquo;t the case anymore.</description>

      <description>NOTE: This post is outdated. It remains here for historical curiosity only. For an up-to-date look at who I am, check out the about page. Hello friends, family, and the internet at large!
For a small handful of you, this isn&amp;rsquo;t news, but for some of you it is. I wanted to do this in a way that gave me a chance to find my words, and also share this information with everyone I care about in one place.</description>
