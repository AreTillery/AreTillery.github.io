      <description>&amp;ldquo;women and non-binary&amp;rdquo; is a common phrase used by well-intentioned people trying to express that folks that don&amp;rsquo;t identify as a binary (male or female) gender are welcome. The trouble is that it isn&amp;rsquo;t clear who is welcome, because non-binary is not a monolith.
Whenever the phrase &amp;ldquo;women and non-binary&amp;rdquo; is used, for example, it feels like it&amp;rsquo;s erasing the identities of a lot of trans and non-binary folks. Often, people who don&amp;rsquo;t understand what it means to be non-binary view or refer to &amp;ldquo;non-binary&amp;rdquo; as &amp;ldquo;women-lite&amp;rdquo; - that is, they treat what is a complex group of gender identities as if they were one identity on the women side of some sort of gender spectrum.</description>
