          <p>What does 2022 hold for me professionally?</p>
<p>2021 was a tough year for me. I travelled several times during the year, and every single time, it was for a funeral. As the end of 2021 approached, one of the things I realized is that I wanted to stop letting myself be afraid of taking risks and letting things pass me by.</p>
<p>One of the things I realized is that while I had been given an amazing opportunity to come in and build something where I was, I had reached a point where I was happy with what I built, and wanted to build something new, for myself this time, instilled with my ideals.</p>
<p>Near the end of the year, I decided that I was going to go one of two ways: either start a company entirely by myself, or partner with someone that I cared about and knew would help me build something with my ideals in mind. So I approached a good friend.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s taken a bit of time to get everything sorted to the point that I wanted to announce where I am and what I&rsquo;m doing, but now&rsquo;s the time!</p>
<p>Together with some other trusted folks, we&rsquo;ve founded a new company, focused on a holistic approach to cyber training and consulting, particularly around cyber risk: <a href="https://twitter.com/Neuvik">Neuvik</a> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/neuvik-solutions/">Solutions</a>. Everything we do couples meaningful, tactical lessons with top-tier organizational guidance.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve existed in earnest since January. It&rsquo;s really cool and I&rsquo;m really proud of what we&rsquo;ve done so far. Greetz to <a href="https://twitter.com/Leirvik">Ryan Leirvik</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/dmay3r">David Mayer</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bigalespo">Alexandria Esposito</a> who form our leadership Steering Committee with me, and <a href="https://twitter.com/mosesrenegade">Moses Frost</a>, who has come on board our red team. Looking forward to 2022!</p>
