          <p>Hello, Internet! This is the long-form version of the about me twitter thread I posted.</p>
<p>There are a lot of things that I am, and I&rsquo;m not sure what order to put them into. I&rsquo;m a big fan of taxonomies when they apply to other things, but bad at labels when they come to me. I guess I&rsquo;ll just get started.</p>
<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m Tillery! I&rsquo;m non-binary and use they/them pronouns. When I first realized I was non-binary and came out, I identified as demimale and used he or they interchangeably - that isn&rsquo;t the case anymore. As I&rsquo;ve continued to explore exactly what my gender identity is, I&rsquo;ve realized that for me demimale was just me clinging to something that felt safe and close to what had been expected. Like I said, labels are hard for me, because as much as I like sorting things into buckets, people don&rsquo;t usually fit cleanly into them. If I was to put a label on my gender identity right now, it would probably be agender. I&rsquo;m also pan (though I&rsquo;m also ok with being labeled as bi). <strong>TL;DR I&rsquo;m queer AF.</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m an introvert (though most people don&rsquo;t believe me), but I also love public speaking and lecturing - it just drains me to do it too much.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big believer in telling the people you love that you love them, romantically, platonically, or otherwise.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a gamer (when I have the time), and a lover of philosophy (particular philosophical ethics).</p>
<h2 id="next-up-career">Next up, career!</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve gone through a few different steps in my career to get where I am today. It&rsquo;s sort of come full circle for me, actually.</p>
<p>Rewinding to college, I started out as a Math major with a minor in Education. I knew going in I was going to be a math teacher. That didn&rsquo;t last too long, though, because I decided pure math wasn&rsquo;t for me. I switched majors twice, first to psychology (which I loved but didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d make a career from), then to Computer Science (which I&rsquo;d taken and loved in high school and knew was a safe fallback). I ended up with a Math/CS degree, but I kept the Education. First thing out of the gate, I did some teaching - ironically mathematics despite my change of majors. It turns out that teaching people that don&rsquo;t want to be there is a bummer, though, so I went back to computers (specifically, HPC and Data Science). I worked general Sys Admin support while also running a Hadoop/HBase cluster in support of Cyber Threat Intelligence for about a year and a half before I came to the conclusion that it was time to move on. The work had been interesting, but the fun bits were starting to wane.</p>
<p>My next step was to change companies (and sort of change careers) again. I went through a 10-week crash course on the cybers, and came out the other end doing Reverse Engineering and Vulnerability Research. I fell in love with it. I stayed at that company for more than 5 years. Finally it was time for another change, but this time it was a change of scenery, not of vocation. I&rsquo;ve been at GRIMM for two and a half years at time of writing. I came on board as an engineer on the AppSec team. I immediately saw a need to push training forward, though!</p>
<p>For a while I worked for several Principles at once helping out (mostly with VR tasks) where I was needed and bouncing around quite a bit. That eventually settled and I fell back under the Principle that had hired me, purely working AppSec. During that time, I picked up some training gigs too, though. As I got more and more into the work under the AppSec lead, I saw the unfortunate fact that he was stuck mostly doing management work (which he does well, but which doesn&rsquo;t excite him) and wanted to find a way to give him at least one day a week doing technical work. I resolved to do what I could to lessen the burden on him and take on some of that responsibility. As a result, I accidentally started helping out leading the practice (which I still do!)</p>
<p>This gradually grew as more and more it became clear that we also needed to pursue and grow as a training organization. Eventually, my pushing (and that of others in the company, I can&rsquo;t claim sole credit!) was successful. A combination of more training work that we&rsquo;d been able to bring in, and the acknowledgement that it&rsquo;s something we could do and do well, and that would be a big boon to the industry, gave us a renewed focus on Training. And that&rsquo;s how I became a Director.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s far from the end of my journey in the cybers, but it mostly brings us to today, so now a little detour into my other &ldquo;work&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="gamers-gonna-game">Gamers gonna game</h2>
<p>Back in college (in the bad old days of 2006), a friend of mine introduced me to Imperian. It was a quirky game, a MUD that was still running well after the 90s, but I fell in love with it. I played it for a while before deciding I wanted to do more.</p>
<p>In 2009/2010, I asked if I could be a volunteer coder for the game. I didn&rsquo;t stick with it. Fast forward a few years, though, and I gave it another shot (and they gave me one). I started coding for Imperian again in 2013.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been a sucker for a good story, so I also did a lot of world building. Eventually, between me and the original creator, it wasn&rsquo;t always clear who had the better answer to lore questions (Jeremy had stepped away from the game a few times to focus on other projects). In 2017, along with a slew of staffing and internal changes with Imperian and Iron Realms in general, I stepped into the role of Assistant Producer, followed by the Producer role in 2018. Unfortunately, with my day job, I don&rsquo;t have much time for Imperian these days. Not nearly as much as I&rsquo;d like, anyway.</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot more about me than all of this, but it&rsquo;s already a long thread for twitter. I may add to or revise this in some way later, who knows. For now, it&rsquo;s nice to meet you!</p>
