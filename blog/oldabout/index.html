I wanted to do this in a way that gave me a chance to find my words, and also share this information with everyone I care about in one place.</p><p><strong>I&rsquo;m coming out publicly as non-binary.</strong></p><p>For many, it&rsquo;s not a surprise at all. I mean, I&rsquo;ve never been a typical cis male. I&rsquo;ve been at least somewhat gender non-conforming for basically as long as I can remember. Off and on for a few years I&rsquo;ve been thinking about gender, both in the abstract and as it applies to me. Recently, I&rsquo;ve been doing that introspection more deeply, and I&rsquo;ve come to a conclusion that I&rsquo;ve passively known for a while, but hadn&rsquo;t explicitly confronted - I don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m a cis male. At least, not all the time. Right now I identify as <a href=https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Demiguy>demimale</a>.</p><p>I don&rsquo;t know where this road is going to lead me, but I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;m not at the end of it. Gender is a complicated thing and I have a lot of exploring to do.</p><p>This is a thing that I&rsquo;ve really just started accepting, but it&rsquo;s also something that I want to tell you, the people who know me. I&rsquo;m still exploring and coming to terms with exactly what that means for me, how I present, and how I&rsquo;d like the world to view and interact with me.</p><p>For now, I&rsquo;m not changing names or pronouns or anything (though I am slightly more comfortable with they/them right now than he/him, that changes day to day), so it won&rsquo;t have much of an impact on how you interact with me or talk about me, but it might change how you think about me.</p><p>Thanks for reading! If you want to reach out to me, you can grab one of my (digital signatures)[/pgp] and shoot me an email, or DM me on twitter (<a href=https://twitter.com/AreTillery>@tomastillery</a>).</p><hr><p>Tomas</p></div></div><div class=disqus></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=container><div class=text-muted>&copy; All rights reserved.
